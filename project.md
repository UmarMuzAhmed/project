# Music Library Database Management System

## Project Description
This project implements a **Music Library Database** designed to manage and retrieve structured music data. The application supports CRUD operations on a relational database with tables like `User`, `Song`, `Album`, `Artist`, `Genre`, and `Favorite`.

The system is ideal for music streaming services, record labels, or music archives that need organized storage and easy search of music information. It supports searching songs by artist, viewing albums, categorizing by genre, and tracking song sales.

The database was built using **SQLite**, a lightweight and serverless relational database engine, and the GUI was developed using **Python with Tkinter**. The application connects to the database using Python's built-in `sqlite3` module.
