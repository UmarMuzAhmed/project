# Music Library Database Management System

The Music Library Database is designed for music platforms, record labels, and digital archives to efficiently manage music data. Built using SQLite, a lightweight and serverless RDBMS, it ensures fast and structured storage with support for SQL joins, foreign key constraints, and relational consistency. Users can search songs by artist, view album details, track sales, and categorize by genre, all within a portable, Python-integrated system.

## Project Description
This project implements a **Music Library Database** designed to manage and retrieve structured music data. The application supports CRUD operations on a relational database with tables like `User`, `Song`, `Album`, `Artist`, `Genre`, and `Favorite`.

The system is ideal for music streaming services, record labels, or music archives that need organized storage and easy search of music information. It supports searching songs by artist, viewing albums, categorizing by genre, and tracking song sales.

The database was built using **SQLite**, a lightweight and serverless relational database engine, and the GUI was developed using **Python with Tkinter**. The application connects to the database using Python's built-in `sqlite3` module.
